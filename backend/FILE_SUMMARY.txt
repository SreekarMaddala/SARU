- Maps table columns to Python class attributes.

3. schemas.py
- Defines Pydantic models for data validation and serialization.
- Includes base, create, and response schemas for Feedback.

4. crud.py
- Contains functions to interact with the database.
- Includes functions to get all feedbacks and create new feedback entries.

5. main.py
- FastAPI application entry point.
- Defines API endpoints for root, getting feedback list, and creating feedback.
- Uses dependency injection to access database sessions.

6. alembic/versions/1234567890_initial.py
- Alembic migration script for initial database schema.
- Creates the feedback table with appropriate columns and indexes.
- Defines upgrade and downgrade functions for migration.

7. requirements.txt
- Lists Python package dependencies for the backend project.
- Includes FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Alembic, psycopg2-binary, python-dotenv, and Pydantic.

This summary provides an overview of the backend files and their roles in the project.

## Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind CSS)

### Overview
The frontend is a React application built with Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. It provides a user interface to display feedback data fetched from the backend API.

### Key Files and Components

1. package.json
- Defines the project name as "feedback-mvp-frontend".
- Includes scripts for development (dev), building (build), linting, and preview.
- Dependencies: React and React DOM for the UI framework.
- DevDependencies: Vite for fast development, Tailwind CSS for styling, ESLint for code quality, and related plugins.

2. vite.config.js
- Configuration file for Vite, specifying the React plugin for JSX support.

3. index.html
- The main HTML template that serves as the entry point for the React app.
- Includes the root div where the React app is mounted.

4. src/main.jsx
- Entry point for the React application.
- Renders the App component into the DOM using ReactDOM.

5. src/App.jsx
- Main application component.
- Fetches feedback data from the backend API endpoint '/feedback' on component mount.
- Displays a title "Feedback Collector MVP ðŸš€" and renders the FeedbackTable component with the fetched data.

6. src/components/FeedbackTable.jsx
- Reusable component that renders a table displaying feedback entries.
- Columns include ID, Company ID, Channel, Text, Sentiment, Topics, and Created At.
- Maps over the feedbacks array and formats dates for display.

7. tailwind.config.js
- Configuration for Tailwind CSS, defining custom themes or extensions if any.

8. postcss.config.js
- Configuration for PostCSS, used by Tailwind CSS for processing styles.

9. src/index.css
- Global CSS file, likely includes Tailwind directives (@tailwind base, components, utilities).

### Functionality Implemented
- Fetches and displays feedback data from the backend.
- Responsive table layout using Tailwind CSS classes.
- No form for submitting new feedback yet; currently read-only display.

### Setup and Deployment
- Install dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`
- Start development server: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
- Deploy to platforms like Vercel or Netlify, publishing the 'dist' directory.

This completes the summary of the entire project, covering both backend and frontend components.
